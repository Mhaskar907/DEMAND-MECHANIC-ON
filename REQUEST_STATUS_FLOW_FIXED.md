# Request Status Flow - Fixed

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. User Side - "Accepted" Requests Now Visible
**Problem:** When mechanic approved a request, it wasn't showing in the user's accepted column.

**Solution:**
- Updated user stats to count both `accepted` AND `in_progress` status as "Accepted"
- Updated filter to show both statuses under "In Progress" label
- Added special message for `in_progress` status: "🔧 Mechanic is working on your vehicle"
- Added icon for `in_progress` status (build icon)

### 2. Mechanic Side - Proper Status Flow
**Problem:** After confirming/accepting a request, it should:
- Be removed from request panel
- Appear in "In Progress" column
- Move to "Completed" when mechanic clicks complete

**Solution:**
- Changed `mechanic_requests_page.dart` to set status to `in_progress` instead of `accepted` when accepting
- Request panel now only shows `pending` requests (filters out accepted/in-progress ones)
- `mechanic_my_requests_page.dart` already has proper tabs and buttons:
  - Pending → "Start Work" button → in_progress
  - In Progress → "Complete Service" button → completed
  - Completed → Just shows as completed

## 📋 New Status Flow

### Complete Flow:
```
1. User creates request
   └─→ Status: 'pending'
   └─→ Shows in: Mechanic's "Request Panel" (mechanic_requests_page)

2. Mechanic clicks "Accept" in Request Panel
   └─→ Status: 'in_progress'
   └─→ Removed from: Request Panel
   └─→ Shows in: Mechanic's "My Requests" → "In Progress" tab
   └─→ User sees: "In Progress" column with message "🔧 Mechanic is working on your vehicle"
   └─→ Notification sent to user

3. Mechanic clicks "Complete Service" in My Requests
   └─→ Status: 'completed'
   └─→ Shows in: Mechanic's "My Requests" → "Completed" tab
   └─→ User sees: "Completed" column
   └─→ Notification sent to user
```

### Alternative Flow (if mechanic goes to My Requests first):
```
1. User creates request
   └─→ Status: 'pending'
   └─→ Shows in: Both "Request Panel" AND "My Requests" → "Pending" tab

2. Mechanic clicks "Start Work" in My Requests
   └─→ Status: 'in_progress'
   └─→ Removed from: Request Panel
   └─→ Shows in: "My Requests" → "In Progress" tab

3. Same completion flow as above
```
